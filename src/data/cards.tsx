          <p>This website was developed through the Travel Advisor and Google Maps API. It allows users to search destinations near or in a particular location they search.
            The ratings and exact address are displayed and the location of the destination can be seen in Google Maps.  
          </p>
          <p>This is my first major project using React and Typescript but the biggest challenge was working with Google Maps API since it was difficult to track boundaries. However, I had a pleasure working on it as I was able to learn the usefulness of maps API that I can build different projects with this and use this website personally. </p>
